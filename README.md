### What makes Object Oriented Design integral to how I think about Coding/Programming/Computer Science?

  Object Oriented Design is an integral part of Computer Science for many factors, both in general for all coders and me personally. Just defining object oreinted coding, it is the material manifestation of code, hence the object. In Layman's terms, it is code being turned into objects. This can be seen in things like buttons and objects that you drag across the screen. Generally they're create using classes. Object Oriented code is a powerful tool in any programmer's "tool belt" for its efficiency. It can turn a 20 line function that makes a square move, into a few lines of code embeded in the object. The beauty of it is that you don't have to code every action that the object makes because that is what the Object Oriented code is supposed to do.
  
  Object Oriented Programming (OOP) helps me think about programming in a different manner. Before I learned it, I was focusing on getting the code together and making it look properly formatted, but now OOP has shown a more efficient way of programming. Now I take into consideration the amount of code that goes into a program. This also allows me to see the code more clearly and plan it out as a program using functional coding would look very different than one using OOP. 

### How will I continue learning about Computer Science?

  Computer Science plays a big role in   

### Summary of working with Khan Academy.

  Through working with Khan Academy, I have improved many of my programming techniques which can be seen through my improvement from the beginning of the course to the end of the course.
